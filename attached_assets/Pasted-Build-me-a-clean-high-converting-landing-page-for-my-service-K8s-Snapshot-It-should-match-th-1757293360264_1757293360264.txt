Build me a clean, high-converting landing page for my service **K8s Snapshot**.  
It should match the design style of my **CloudNative Inc. logo** and my current sales slick page (light background, professional, CloudNative blue `#0B5D94` as primary color, soft gray dividers, rounded pills, and minimal shadows).  

The landing page must follow a direct-response marketer structure, with multiple CTAs, a clear USP, and strong risk reversal.
